    <h2>Weekly Snapshots</h2>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>Plan for week: 14/10/25</h3>
        <p>The plan for the next week is to look over the infomation we have recieved from the client and finalise
            design decisions. Then implementation can begin, we will start with a basic character movement, a timer and
            some essential UI that links to the pausing and unpausing functions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>Plan for week: 21/10/25</h3>
        <p>The plan for this week is to switch the project architecture from OOP to MVC, this will improve
            maintainability and stability. Map design will also be finalised, with the map being implemented into the
            project and hitboxes added. Additional art assets will also be implemented, these include assets such as
            people.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>Plan for week: 01/11/25</h3>
        <p>The plan for this week is to implement the score feature. The score feature will rely on the events, which
            will also need to be implemented, these include the powerups and the hidden event. Sound will also be
            implemented, although this is a low priority goal. The final task will be to implement bug fixes and ensure
            the game performs as expected.</p>
